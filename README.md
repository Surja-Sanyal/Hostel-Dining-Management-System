# Mess-Management-System
A Microsoft Excel-based hostel dining management tool with a VBA backend.

This hostel dining management system prototype is based on Microsoft Excel with VBA coding on the backend.

Version 1 (_V1) has dropdowns for choosing one unit of extra items taken.
Version 2 (_V2) has counters for choosing the quantity of extra items take.
Version 3 (_V3) extends _V2 by considering dining facility offs and leaves of hostel boarders.

Both versions provide the same results.

Please enable "macros with digital signatures" for this tool to work.
